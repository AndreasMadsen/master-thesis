\chapter{Acknowledgements}
First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor Ole Winther for his guidance and support. I would also like to thank Namju Kim, who wrote a quadratic-time implementation of the ByteNet model, which I took much inspiration from. Finally, I would like to thank the DTU HPC team for their fast support.
